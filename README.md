🚀 Browser History Manager

A simple Java-based console application for managing browser tabs using a doubly linked list and stacks.

✨ Features

📌 Open new tabs by entering a URL.

⏪ Navigate back to previously opened tabs.

⏩ Navigate forward to the next tab (if available).

📜 Display the current tab.

🛠 Technologies Used

☕ Java

📚 Stacks (for back and forward navigation)

🔗 Linked List (for tab structure)

🔍 How It Works

When a new tab is opened, it gets stored as the current tab.

The back stack stores previously visited tabs for backward navigation.

The forward stack stores tabs for forward navigation.
